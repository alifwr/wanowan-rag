Subject: Order Still Not Delivered After 3 Weeks

I placed an order on September 20th (Order #ORD-56784) for my daughter's birthday present. The estimated delivery was September 27th, but it's now October 12th and I still haven't received the package.

The tracking information hasn't been updated in over 10 days - it just says "In Transit" with no other details. I've contacted customer support twice via email but only received automated responses saying they're "looking into it."

This is completely unacceptable. The birthday has already passed and now the gift is pointless. I want to know:
1. Where is my package?
2. Why has there been no communication about the delay?
3. What compensation will you offer for this terrible experience?

If I don't receive a proper response within 24 hours, I will be filing a dispute with my credit card company and leaving reviews on every platform I can find.

Very disappointed.
