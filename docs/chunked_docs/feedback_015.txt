Subject: Unexpected Customs Fees and Poor Communication

I'm writing from Canada and recently ordered from your US-based store. While I was excited about the products, the international shipping experience has been terrible.

PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED:

1. HIDDEN COSTS: At checkout, I paid $25 for "international shipping" but received zero information about potential customs fees, duties, or taxes. When the package arrived, I had to pay an additional $47 CAD in customs fees and handling charges. The total shipping cost was almost as much as the product itself!

2. SHIPPING DELAYS: Estimated delivery was 7-10 business days. It took 21 days. The tracking information stopped updating once it left the US, leaving me completely in the dark for two weeks.

3. INCORRECT CUSTOMS DECLARATION: The customs form listed the wrong product value, which caused issues with the customs office. I had to provide my order receipt to correct it.

4. NO INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT: Your customer service operates during US business hours only. The time zone difference (I'm PST but 3 hours ahead doesn't help much) made it nearly impossible to get real-time support.

WHAT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED:

- Clear disclosure of potential customs fees at checkout (or include them in shipping cost)
- Accurate delivery estimates for international orders
- Tracking that works across borders
- Proper customs documentation
- International customer service hours or better self-service options

SUGGESTIONS:

- Add a customs fee calculator at checkout
- Partner with DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) carriers so customers pay everything upfront
- Provide country-specific shipping information pages
- Offer "international express" with better tracking
- Create an international shipping FAQ

I love your products but won't order internationally again unless these issues are addressed. You're losing significant business from international customers.
