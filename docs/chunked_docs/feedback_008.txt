Subject: Website Design Improvements Needed

As a UX designer myself, I wanted to provide some constructive feedback on your website's user interface. Overall, the site functions, but there's significant room for improvement.

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:

1. Navigation Menu: The mega menu has too many categories and subcategories. It's overwhelming and takes up half the screen. Consider a simpler, more organized structure.

2. Product Images: On mobile devices, product images are too small and you can't zoom in properly. The pinch-to-zoom feature doesn't work consistently.

3. Color Contrast: Some text (especially sale prices in red) has poor contrast against the background, making it hard to read, especially for people with visual impairments. This is an accessibility issue.

4. Button Placement: The "Add to Cart" button is below the fold on many product pages. Users shouldn't have to scroll to find the primary action.

5. Loading Times: Pages take 4-5 seconds to load, which is too slow by modern standards. Consider image optimization and lazy loading.

6. Checkout Progress Indicator: There's no clear indication of how many steps are left in the checkout process.

SUGGESTIONS:

- Implement a breadcrumb navigation system
- Add a sticky "Add to Cart" button on product pages
- Use a more modern, minimalist design
- Improve accessibility (WCAG 2.1 compliance)
- Add skeleton screens while content loads
- Include customer reviews at the top of product pages

I'm sharing this because I like your products and want the platform to succeed. Happy to discuss further if you want detailed mockups.
