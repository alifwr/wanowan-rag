Subject: Search Function Needs Major Improvement

The search functionality on your website is really frustrating to use. Here are the specific issues I've encountered:

1. POOR RELEVANCE: When I search for "wireless bluetooth headphones," I get results for wired headphones, phone cases, and other random electronics. The actual Bluetooth headphones are buried on page 3 or 4.

2. NO FILTERS PERSIST: If I apply filters (price range, brand, rating), they reset when I click on a product and come back to the results page.

3. TYPO INTOLERANCE: If I misspell something slightly (like "blutooth" instead of "bluetooth"), I get zero results instead of suggested corrections.

4. SORTING ISSUES: The "Sort by Price" option seems broken - items aren't actually sorted in price order.

Suggestions:
- Implement better search algorithms (maybe AI-based?)
- Add "Did you mean...?" suggestions for typos
- Keep filters active during the entire browsing session
- Add more filter options (color, size, material, etc.)
- Show "Frequently Bought Together" suggestions

The products are great, but finding them is a nightmare. Please prioritize fixing the search experience.
