Subject: Gift Wrapping Service Exceeded Expectations

I ordered a birthday gift for my mother and selected your gift wrapping service for an additional $7.99. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I'm absolutely delighted with the result!

WHAT WAS EXCELLENT:

The wrapping was gorgeous - high-quality paper with an elegant design, professional folding and taping, and a beautiful ribbon. It honestly looked better than anything I could do myself, and saved me a lot of time.

The included gift card had my personalized message written in beautiful calligraphy (I wasn't expecting that!). My mother was so impressed she actually saved the wrapping paper.

The gift box was sturdy and protected the item perfectly during shipping. Everything arrived in pristine condition.

VALUE FOR MONEY:
$7.99 is very reasonable for this level of quality. I've paid more at physical stores for worse wrapping.

SUGGESTIONS:

1. Offer different wrapping paper designs/themes (birthday, holiday, wedding, baby shower, etc.) - let customers choose

2. Add a photo of the wrapped gift to the order confirmation email so customers can see what it looks like

3. Offer a "luxury" gift wrapping tier for special occasions ($12-15 with premium materials)

4. Include a small "unwrapping video" instruction card so recipients can capture the moment

5. Provide gift receipt options more prominently at checkout

6. Allow customers to add a small gift tag with "To/From" information separate from the card message

This service has converted me into a regular customer. I'll be using your store for all my gift purchases now. Please advertise this service more - it's a huge differentiator!
