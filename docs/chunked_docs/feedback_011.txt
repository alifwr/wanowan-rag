Subject: URGENT - Potential Security Vulnerability

I'm a cybersecurity professional and I've noticed what appears to be a significant security issue on your website that needs immediate attention.

THE ISSUE:
When I view my order history, the URL contains my full customer information including what appears to be an unencrypted customer ID and order details as query parameters. Example:
yoursite.com/orders?customerID=4472&email=myemail@domain.com

This means:
1. Anyone looking over my shoulder can see my customer ID and email
2. This information could be logged in browser history on shared computers
3. If I share my screen, this sensitive data is visible
4. It's vulnerable to URL manipulation attacks

ADDITIONAL CONCERNS:
- I don't see two-factor authentication (2FA) options for account security
- The password reset process only requires email verification (no additional security questions)
- Saved payment methods show the last 4 digits on the account page (secure, but why display at all?)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. IMMEDIATELY fix the URL parameter issue - use POST requests or session tokens instead
2. Implement 2FA for user accounts
3. Add security questions for password resets
4. Conduct a full security audit
5. Consider a bug bounty program

I'm reporting this to you first rather than publicly disclosing it, but this needs to be addressed within days, not weeks. Customer data security should be your top priority.

I can provide more technical details if your security team wants to contact me directly.

Rating: 2/5 stars (only because of this critical issue)
