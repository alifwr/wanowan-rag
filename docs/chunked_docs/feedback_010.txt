Subject: Return Policy is Confusing and Inconsistent

I'm trying to return a pair of shoes that don't fit, but your return policy is extremely confusing and seems to vary depending on where I look.

CONTRADICTIONS I FOUND:

1. The homepage footer says "60-day returns"
2. The FAQ page says "30-day returns on most items"
3. The email confirmation I received says "Returns accepted within 45 days"
4. The product page for the shoes I bought says "All footwear sales are final"

Which one is correct?? I bought these shoes 25 days ago, so depending on which policy applies, I may or may not be able to return them.

I contacted customer support via chat and got conflicting information:
- First agent: "You can return shoes within 30 days if unworn"
- Second agent: "Footwear cannot be returned for hygiene reasons"

I tried the shoes on once indoors on carpet - they're in perfect condition with tags still attached. I just need a half size larger.

PLEASE:
1. Clarify your return policy with specific, consistent information
2. Make sure all pages show the same policy
3. Train customer service to give accurate information
4. Specify exceptions clearly (if footwear has different rules, state it prominently)

I shouldn't need a law degree to figure out if I can return something. This ambiguity makes me hesitant to buy from you again.
