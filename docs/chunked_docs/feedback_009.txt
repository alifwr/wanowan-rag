Subject: Misleading Product Descriptions

I recently purchased a "leather" laptop bag (Product ID: PROD-4429) based on the description that clearly stated it was made from "genuine leather." When the product arrived, the material is obviously synthetic/faux leather - you can tell immediately from the texture and smell.

I'm not necessarily upset about the faux leather itself (it actually looks decent), but I AM upset about the misleading description. If I had known it wasn't real leather, I would have made a different purchasing decision or at least expected a different quality level.

Looking through other product pages, I've noticed similar issues:
- A "wireless speaker" that actually requires a cable for setup
- "Waterproof" phone case that's only "water-resistant"
- T-shirts described as "100% cotton" when the tag shows 65% cotton / 35% polyester blend

This isn't just poor copywriting - it's false advertising and could get you into legal trouble. More importantly, it damages customer trust.

RECOMMENDATION: Audit all product descriptions for accuracy and have someone verify claims before publishing. Consider adding a "Verified Description" badge for products that have been double-checked.

I'm keeping the bag because I need it, but I've lost trust in your product descriptions and will be much more skeptical of future purchases.
