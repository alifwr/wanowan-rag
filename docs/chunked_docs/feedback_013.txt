Subject: TOO MANY EMAILS - This is Becoming Harassment

I need to address your email marketing strategy because it's gotten completely out of control.

THE PROBLEM:
I'm receiving 3-5 marketing emails from you EVERY SINGLE DAY. This is not an exaggeration - I counted 23 emails from your company in the past week alone.

EMAIL BREAKDOWN:
- Daily "Flash Sale" emails (often for products I've never shown interest in)
- "Don't Miss Out" reminder emails for sales I already saw
- "Abandoned Cart" emails (even when I was just browsing, not seriously shopping)
- Product recommendation emails based on unclear logic
- "We miss you" emails (I literally placed an order 3 days ago!)
- Survey requests
- Newsletter (which I actually want, but it's buried in all the spam)

I've tried to unsubscribe from promotional emails THREE TIMES, but:
1. The unsubscribe link sometimes doesn't work
2. When it does work, I still receive "transactional" emails that are obviously promotional
3. I keep getting re-subscribed somehow

IMPACT:
- Your legitimate emails (order confirmations, shipping updates) get lost in the noise
- I've started sending all your emails to spam, which means I might miss important updates
- This aggressive marketing has the opposite effect - it makes me want to shop elsewhere

WHAT I WANT:
- Immediate removal from ALL marketing lists
- Only transactional emails (orders, shipping, returns)
- An explanation of how your unsubscribe process failed three times

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Reduce email frequency to 2-3 per week MAXIMUM
- Honor unsubscribe requests immediately and permanently
- Provide granular email preferences (let customers choose what types of emails they want)
- Don't re-subscribe people automatically

This is bordering on harassment and potentially violates email marketing regulations. Fix this before you face legal issues.
