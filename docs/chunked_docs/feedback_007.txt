Subject: Cannot Complete Purchase - Payment Keeps Failing

I've been trying to purchase items for the past 2 hours and keep getting an error at the payment stage. This is extremely frustrating!

The error message says: "Payment processing failed. Please try again or use a different payment method."

What I've tried:
- 3 different credit cards (all are active and have sufficient funds)
- PayPal account
- Cleared browser cache and cookies
- Tried on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Attempted on both desktop and mobile

The same error appears every time. I called my bank and they confirmed there are no issues on their end - no declined transactions are even showing up, which suggests the payment isn't even reaching the processor.

I really want to complete this purchase as several items in my cart are on sale today, but I'm about to give up and shop elsewhere. This is costing you sales!

Please fix this critical bug immediately. I'd also appreciate a discount code for the trouble once this is resolved.
