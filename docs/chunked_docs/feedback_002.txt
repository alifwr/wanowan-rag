Subject: Cart Items Disappearing on Mobile App

I've been experiencing a frustrating bug on the mobile app (iOS version 3.2.1). Every time I add items to my cart and switch to another app or lock my phone, when I come back to the e-commerce app, my cart is completely empty.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open the app and browse products
2. Add 3-4 items to cart
3. Press home button or lock phone
4. Wait 2-3 minutes
5. Reopen the app
6. Cart is empty

This has happened 5 times in the past week. I've tried logging out and back in, reinstalling the app, but the problem persists. It's making it impossible to shop on mobile.

Device: iPhone 13 Pro
iOS Version: 17.6.1
App Version: 3.2.1

Please fix this issue urgently.
