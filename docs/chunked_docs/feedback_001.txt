Subject: Damaged Item Received - Winter Jacket

I ordered a premium winter jacket (Order #ORD-78923) last week and received it yesterday. Unfortunately, the jacket arrived with a large tear on the left sleeve and the zipper is completely broken. The packaging was intact, so this seems to be a quality control issue from the warehouse.

I've been a loyal customer for 3 years and this is the first time I've experienced such poor quality. I would like a replacement sent as soon as possible, or a full refund if a replacement is not available.

Please prioritize this issue as winter is approaching and I need a functional jacket.
